## Description

Create Custom Alerts + Be notified by email/SMS!

Alerts are a great way to get notified of changes on your website. Want to know if your new product hits less than 100 sales in a week or your new article attracts more than 200 visitors a day? Create alerts that make sense to you. Be notified by email or SMS when the conditions for your alerts are met. Stay on top of your website!

The Alert log will help you to better understand the success of your website. You can use it to analyze how often your website hit more than 10000 visits per day or on how many days a product was sold more than 50 times.

This plugin was crowdfunded with the support of 37 Matomo community members!
